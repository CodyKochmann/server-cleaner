Description| A coffeescript based cleaner for static file servers since the user interphase for file servers right now is a little bare bones.
Usage| this could be used as a footer script in a file server page for devs that dont want to design everything. It can also be used  as a bookmarklet for those who like this idea and would like to just have it as a tool that is always there for them.
